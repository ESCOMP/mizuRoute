<expectedFails version="1.1">

  <!-- Notes about the format of this file:

       The required elements for a given failure are just:

         <test name="...">
           <phase name="...">
             <status>...</status>
           </phase>
         </test>

       There can be multiple phase blocks in a given test block.

       In addition, a number of optional elements are allowed, which
       currently are just for human consumption (not parsed by any
       scripts):

       - A phase block can contain an "issue" element, which gives the
       issue number associated with this failure. (#123 refers to issue
       #123 in the ESCOMP/mizuRoute repository. Issues in other repositories
       should be specified as ORG/repo#123 - e.g., ESMCI/cime#123.)

       - A phase block can contain a "comment" element, which gives any
       sort of comment you desire.
