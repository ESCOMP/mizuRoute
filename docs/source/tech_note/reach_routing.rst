River routing methods
======================

mizuRoute include five different routing methods. The routing method(s) are applied to each river reach to compute outflow from the reach. The methods are Impulse response function, Lagrangian kinmatic wave, Euler kinematic wave, Muskingum Cunge, and Diffusive wave.
This section describe each method including numerical implementation.
