Introduction
============

This document describes mizuRoute setting and input data. The routing schemes used in mizuRoute is described in `GMD paper <https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/9/2223/2016/>`_.
Version 1.1 uses different workflow than Version1.0. In brief, the river network augmentation program is merged into routing program thanks to improved efficiency of augmentation computation.
Version 1.1 can be still used as river network augmentation purpose.
