Introduction
============

User's guide provides the following instructions on setup mizuRoute:

:doc:`1.2. Building model <Build_model>` provide stand-alone mizuRoute build instruction: external libraries requirement and step-by-step instruction on how to compile the model.

:doc:`1.3. Control file <Control_file>` provide information on how to setup a control file (configuration file), and various control variables.

:doc:`1.4. Input data <Input_data>` provide input data requirement for river routing, not including advanced features: lake, and water management.

:doc:`1.5. River model parameters <seg_hru_param>` provides information on river network topology and physical parameters.

:doc:`1.6. Lake model setup <lake>` section provide instructions on how to modify river network into river-lake network, lake model parameter specification, control variable related to lake model.
For scientific description is provided in :doc:`Lake water balance computation <lake_routing>`.

:doc:`1.7. Water management option <water_management>` section provides additional data inputs related to water managments, control variables related to water management.

:doc:`1.8. testCase data <testCase>` provide a link to testCase including model setup and data for river routing only.
